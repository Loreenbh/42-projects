Inception is a project to deploy a **full web stack** using Docker containers:

1. **MariaDB** – Database service with persistent storage  
2. **Nginx** – Web server and SSL reverse proxy  
3. **WordPress** – CMS connected to MariaDB  
4. **SSL** – Self-signed certificates generated automatically  
5. **Automation** – Scripts and Makefile to manage containers and data  

All services are isolated in containers, with proper networking and persistence.
